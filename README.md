# Module-2-Challenge

## Description

- The challenge was to create a portfolio from scratch with no starter code. This project was built to start as my working portfolio in class and to share out post completing the bootcamp.
- I learned how to use everything that I have learned and my resources in class to make this portfolio come to life.

## Installation

1. I first started with powerpoint to draw out how I wanted my portfolio to look.
2. I then created a repo and an HTML/CSS file.
3. Once my HTML outline was complete I worked in CSS to design my portfolio.
4. I then created my READ.ME file and deployed my work using github pages.

Powerpoint screenshot included:


## Usage

This portfolio can be used to review all my top accomplishments throughout the bootcamp such as my modules, challenges, and prework study guide. This portfolio can also be provided to future employers to review my work and for further connections.
